My name is Nash Kaminski and I am currently pursuing a BS and MS in computer engineering coterminally at Illinois Institute of Technology. Ever since I was rather young, I have always been very curious as to why and how things work and why certain events happen as they do. Furthermore, I have also had a strong interest in electronics and computers. My first experiences with such go back as early as grade school, creating simple electric circuits that over time evolved into progressively more advanced ones as well as many hours of playing retro games and tinkering in visual BASIC on my first computer, an  Apple IIc. Owing to my strong work ethic and desire to learn, I have continued to advance over the years in terms of knowledge and problem solving capability and have since been involved in progressively more involved pursuits. As more time passed, I also became more and more certain that I would like to pursue a future where I could apply such knowledge in a practical manner. Therefore, I have chosen to study computer engineering and envision myself working in the field of computer hardware design in the near future.
